clarify_with_user_instructions="""
These are the messages that have been exchanged so far from the user asking for the report:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

Today's date is {date}.

Assess whether you need to ask a clarifying question, or if the user has already provided enough information for you to start research.
IMPORTANT: If you can see in the messages history that you have already asked a clarifying question, you almost always do not need to ask another one. Only ask another question if ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

If there are acronyms, abbreviations, or unknown terms, ask the user to clarify.
If you need to ask a question, follow these guidelines:
- Be concise while gathering all necessary information
- Make sure to gather all the information needed to carry out the research task in a concise, well-structured manner.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists if appropriate for clarity. Make sure that this uses markdown formatting and will be rendered correctly if the string output is passed to a markdown renderer.
- Don't ask for unnecessary information, or information that the user has already provided. If you can see that the user has already provided the information, do not ask for it again.

Respond in valid JSON format with these exact keys:
"need_clarification": boolean,
"question": "<question to ask the user to clarify the report scope>",
"verification": "<verification message that we will start research>"

If you need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": true,
"question": "<your clarifying question>",
"verification": ""

If you do not need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": false,
"question": "",
"verification": "<acknowledgement message that you will now start research based on the provided information>"

For the verification message when no clarification is needed:
- Acknowledge that you have sufficient information to proceed
- Briefly summarize the key aspects of what you understand from their request
- Confirm that you will now begin the research process
- Keep the message concise and professional

transform_messages_into_research_topic_prompt = """You will be given a set of messages that have been exchanged so far between yourself and the user. 
Your job is to translate these messages into a more detailed and concrete research question that will be used to guide the research.

The messages that have been exchanged so far between yourself and the user are:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

Today's date is {date}.

You will return a single research question that will be used to guide the research.

Guidelines:
1. Maximize Specificity and Detail
- Include all known user preferences and explicitly list key attributes or dimensions to consider.
- It is important that all details from the user are included in the instructions.

2. Handle Unstated Dimensions Carefully
- When research quality requires considering additional dimensions that the user hasn't specified, acknowledge them as open considerations rather than assumed preferences.
- Example: Instead of assuming "budget-friendly options," say "consider all price ranges unless cost constraints are specified."
- Only mention dimensions that are genuinely necessary for comprehensive research in that domain.

3. Avoid Unwarranted Assumptions
- Never invent specific user preferences, constraints, or requirements that weren't stated.
- If the user hasn't provided a particular detail, explicitly note this lack of specification.
- Guide the researcher to treat unspecified aspects as flexible rather than making assumptions.

4. Distinguish Between Research Scope and User Preferences
- Research scope: What topics/dimensions should be investigated (can be broader than user's explicit mentions)
- User preferences: Specific constraints, requirements, or preferences (must only include what user stated)
- Example: "Research coffee quality factors (including bean sourcing, roasting methods, brewing techniques) for San Francisco coffee shops, with primary focus on taste as specified by the user."

5. Use the First Person
- Phrase the request from the perspective of the user.

6. Sources
- If specific sources should be prioritized, specify them in the research question.
- For product and travel research, prefer linking directly to official or primary websites (e.g., official brand sites, manufacturer pages, or reputable e-commerce platforms like Amazon for user reviews) rather than aggregator sites or SEO-heavy blogs.
- For academic or scientific queries, prefer linking directly to the original paper or official journal publication rather than survey papers or secondary summaries.
- For people, try linking directly to their LinkedIn profile, or their personal website if they have one.
- If the query is in a specific language, prioritize sources published in that language.

query_writer_instructions = """Your goal is to generate sophisticated and diverse web search queries. These queries are intended for an advanced automated web research tool capable of analyzing complex results, following links, and synthesizing information.

Instructions:
- Always prefer a single search query, only add another query if the original question requests multiple aspects or elements and one query is not enough.
- Each query should focus on one specific aspect of the original question.
- Don't produce more than {number_queries} queries.
- Queries should be diverse, if the topic is broad, generate more than 1 query.
- Don't generate multiple similar queries, 1 is enough.
- Query should ensure that the most current information is gathered. The current date is {current_date}.

Format: 
- Format your response as a JSON object with ALL two of these exact keys:
   - "rationale": Brief explanation of why these queries are relevant
   - "query": A list of search queries

Example:

Topic: What revenue grew more last year apple stock or the number of people buying an iphone
```json
{{
    "rationale": "To answer this comparative growth question accurately, we need specific data points on Apple's stock performance and iPhone sales metrics.

Instructions:
- Query should ensure that the most current information is gathered. The current date is {current_date}.
- Conduct multiple, diverse searches to gather comprehensive information.
- Consolidate key findings while meticulously tracking the source(s) for each specific piece of information.
- The output should be a well-written summary or report based on your search findings.

Instructions:
- Identify knowledge gaps or areas that need deeper exploration and generate a follow-up query. (1 or multiple).
- If provided summaries are sufficient to answer the user's question, don't generate a follow-up query.
- If there is a knowledge gap, generate a follow-up query that would help expand your understanding.
- Focus on technical details, implementation specifics, or emerging trends that weren't fully covered.

Requirements:
- Ensure the follow-up query is self-contained and includes necessary context for web search.

Output Format:
- Format your response as a JSON object with these exact keys:
   - "is_sufficient": true or false
   - "knowledge_gap": Describe what information is missing or needs clarification
   - "follow_up_queries": Write a specific question to address this gap
